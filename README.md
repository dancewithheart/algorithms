# Algorithms

Old experiments - on implementing some algorithms in Scala using TDD,
based on coursera [Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and [Algorithms II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) courses.

Warning!
Very imperative, very naive :)

Experiments with [FP algorithms and data structures](https://github.com/lemastero/fp-algorithms-data-structures).
